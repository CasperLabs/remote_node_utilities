# remote_node_utilities

This is a collection of scripts and utilities that can be used by a node operator.  

These are a work in progress and there is no expectation of support for them.

If you don't understand what the script does YOU SHOULD NOT RUN IT.

In this repo, node operators can collaborate on utilities to make handling a node easier.
